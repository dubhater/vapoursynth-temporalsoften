TemporalSoften filter for VapourSynth.

This is a port of the internal Avisynth filter TemporalSoften.

Only one mode is implemented because each mode requires decoding a function written in assembly and that's somewhat annoying. I picked mode 2 because QTGMC uses it.

The filter's parameters are the same as in the original.

To compile the filter:
clang -Wall -Wextra -Wno-unused-parameter -shared -fPIC -o libtemporalsoften.so temporalsoften.c

Currently tested only in Linux.
